## Run

If configured as source generator (see @ref:[setup](setup.md)) SCRAML will generate API types
on a `compile` in `sbt`.

Note that scraml will check for changes on the RAML files. You might want to `clean` the project to 
freshly generate all files.

It is possible to manually run the generator with the `runScraml` command.
